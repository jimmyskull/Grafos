Queue
=====

Read a list for processes, each line composed by two numbers, the first is
the process ID and the second the process priority.

I want the order of how these processes should be executed, based on priority.
Lower number is higher priority, which is from 1 to 5.

Example
-------

Input:
1 5
2 5
3 3
4 3
5 1
6 1

Output:
5
6
3
4
2
1
