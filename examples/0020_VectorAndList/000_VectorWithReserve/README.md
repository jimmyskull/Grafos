Vector
======

The elements of a vector are stored contiguously.  The constructor accepts
a value for capacity reservation.

If I want to create the vector with 500 elements capacity I just do
vector<type> v(500);

This example will create a vector reserving 10 elements capacity.  Then it 
will read the values from stdin and store in the vector.
